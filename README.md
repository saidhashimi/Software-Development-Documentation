# Software-Development-Documentation
In software engineering, technical documentation refers to all written documents and resources related to the development of software products. Whether generated by a small team or a large business, all software development products require some form of documentation. Throughout the software development lifecycle, various sorts of documents are developed (SDLC). Documentation exists to clarify product functionality, unify project-related information, and allow stakeholders and developers to discuss any significant questions that arise.


# Documentation Details
The documentation is divided into five chapters, each of which explains how to create technical documentation for your software project.
